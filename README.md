# FileEncryptor

FileEncryptor is a Java-based application that provides file encryption and decryption functionalities using various algorithms such as AES, DES, and Blowfish.

## Features

- **Encrypt Files**: Secure your files using AES, DES, or Blowfish encryption algorithms.
- **Decrypt Files**: Restore your encrypted files to their original state.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing for easy interaction.
- **Size Limit**: Files up to the size of 2GB (approx 2.14) can be Encrypted.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK 16 or higher is installed on your system.
- **Gradle**: Ensure that gradle 7 or higher is installed on your system.
